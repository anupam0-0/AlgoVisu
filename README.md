# VTRACE:Visualization Tool for Real-time Algorithm Comprehension & Exploration

VTRACE:Visualization Tool for Real-time Algorithm Comprehension & Exploration is a web application for visualizing algorithms and data structures. It provides interactive visualizations for arrays, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and sorting algorithms, helping users understand how these structures and algorithms work step by step.

## Features

- Visualize common data structures: Array, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph
- Visualize sorting algorithms and their steps
- Interactive controls for stepping through algorithms
- Modern, responsive UI with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- Built with Next.js and React
